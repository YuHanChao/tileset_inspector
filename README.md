2. **Set Tile Size**: Enter the pixel size of your single tile.
3. **Set Grid Dimensions**: Input the number of tiles in each row and column.
4. **Start Testing!**: Tiles will show up on the sidebar, click on the ones you want to test and they'll be displayed in your canvas!
5. **Refine Your Art?**:
   - Back: Use "BACK" to remove the last tile you placed.
